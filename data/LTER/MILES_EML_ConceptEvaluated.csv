MILES,EML,12.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"The fundamental long-term objective of the seabird component of the Palmer LTER (PAL) has been to identify and understand the mechanistic processes that regulate the mean fitness (population growth rate) of regional penguin populations. Two hypotheses have guided this research, with one suggesting that population mean fitness is best explained by changes in regional krill biomass, and the other proposing that long-term changes in sea ice affects mean fitness by tipping the balance in favor of one species over another in accordance with species-specific evolved life history affinities to sea ice. Although these hypotheses are not mutually exclusive, current evidence in the PAL region tends to favor the latter over the former. Since the inception of PAL, AdÃ©lie penguin populations have effectively collapsed, while those of gentoo and chinstrap penguins have increased dramatically, trends that are spatially and temporally coherent with decreasing regional sea ice duration. AdÃ©lie penguins are an ice-obligate polar species whose life history is intimately linked to the presence of sea ice, while chinstrap and gentoo penguins are ice-intolerant species whose life histories evolved in the sub-Antarctic, where sea ice is a less permanent feature of the marine ecosystem. In contrast, although krill constitute the most important component of the summer diets by mass of these three penguin species, changes in PAL krill abundances have exhibited no long-term trends, and thus fail to explain the divergent patterns in penguin populations evident in our time series. Fish occur frequently in AdÃ©lie penguin diets but rarely as whole specimens, hence recording their presence in sorted subsamples (see DIET) is generally limited to noting the incidence of skin, flesh, bones, eyes and especially otoliths. With the exception of otoliths, the weights of these items are obtained if warranted by the sample size. Otoliths can be used to identify individual fish species, and in combination with regression equations based on otolith length and width, can also be used to reconstitute fish length and mass. However, because the expertise needed to identify fish from otoliths does not exist within the PAL program, otolith identification is performed by off-site experts as time and funding allow. This results in long lags between the time otoliths are collected and integrated with the appropriate databases, meaning that understanding the role of fish in AdÃ©lie penguin diets still remains a longer-term objective of PAL."

MILES,EML,15.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"A snowfence was built in 1993 on the Niwot Ridge Saddle grid to determine the effects of changes in snowpack on a number of variables. The study area was 60m x 125m. Snow depths were measured at each of 147 points within the snowfence experiment area and at 6 control locations outside of but near the snowfence experiment area. Of the 147 points, 84 were located on the leeward (east) side of the snowfence, 56 were located on the windward (west) side of the snowfence, and 7 were located along the snowfence itself. These measurements were made weekly to biweekly. Sampling locations were each given a unique point indentification number in order that these data could be incorporated into the Saddle GIS. The snowfence was oriented in a north/south direction and was 60 m long. Each of the point identification numbers had a coordinate within the experiment area. The first number of the coordinate was the distance in m from the snowfence in an east/west direction, negative numbers being west of the snowfence and positive numbers being east of the fence. The second number in the coordinate was the distance in m from the southern terminus of the snowfence in a northerly direction. Point identification numbers and coordinates for the windward drift were: 200 (-40,0), 201 (-40,10), 202 (-40,20), 203 (-40,30), 204 (-40,40), 205 (-40,50), 206 (-40,60), 207 (-35,0), 208 (-35,10), 209 (-35,20), 210 (-35,30), 211 (-35,40), 212 (-35,50), 213 (-35,60), 214 (-30,0), 215 (-30,10), 216 (-30,20), 217 (-30,30), 218 (-30,40), 219 (-30,50), 220 (-30,60), 221 (-25,0), 222 (-25,10), 223 (-25,20), 224 (-25,30), 225 (-25,40), 226 (-25,50), 227 (-25,60), 228 (-20,0), 229 (-20,10), 230 (-20,20), 231 (-20,30), 232 (-20,40), 233 (-20,50), 234 (-20,60), 235 (-15,0), 236 (-15,10), 237 (-15,20), 238 (-15,30), 239 (-15,40), 240 (-15,50), 241 (-15,60), 242 (-10,0), 243 (-10,10), 244 (-10,20), 245 (-10,30), 246 (-10,40), 247 (-10,50), 248 (-10,60), 249 (-5,0), 250 (-5,10), 251 (-5,20), 252 (-5,30), 253 (-5,40), 254 (-5,50), 255 (-5,60).

International Association of Hydrological Sciences, Wallingford, UK, IAHS-AIHS Publication no. 228. 465 pp. Snow depth measurements at the control points were not initiated until 9 January 1993. Prior to the spring of 1995, two distinct lenticular drifts formed, a large leeward and a smaller windward drift. As a result of the unusually heavy snows during the spring of 1995, these two drifts actually merged to form a single large drift that engulfed the snowfence itself. Consequently snow depths were recorded at the fence during the spring of 1995, and these measurements were originally listed in the comments section of this file. In the spring of 1996 it was determined that measurements should be routinely taken along the snowfence. The entry and processing programs were changed accordingly and the 1995 snow depths were inserted into the data section. The hard copy data form for 26 July 1995 contained the following comment written by Lee Turner 'Put down 26 July 95 as the last day with any snow in the snowfence area'. The hard copy data form for 31 January 1996 contained the following comment written by Lee Turner 'snow fell with no wind, 30' of fresh powder'. Notes on the hard copy data form for 28 January 1996 indicated that an ice lens was present at coordinates 10,40 (ID #267) and 20,40 (ID #282).

After consultation with L. Turner it was determined that there may have been an ice lens at those coordinates.

The principal study site is the Plum Island Sound estuary, its coupled Parker, Rowley and Ipswich River watersheds and the adjacent coastal ocean, the Gulf of Maine. The PIE LTER focuses on how several aspects of global change influence organic matter and inorganic nutrient biogeochemistry and estuarine foodwebs. The inputs of organic matter and nutrients from land, ocean and marshes interact with the external drivers (climate, land use, river discharge, sea level) to dictate the extent and degree of nutrient and organic matter processing and determine the spatial patterns of estuarine productivity and trophic structure.

The Plum Island Ecosystems (PIE) LTER site, is located in northeastern Massachusetts, 42.72 N, 70.85 W.

Three watersheds comprise the estuarine drainage basin: Parker (155 km2), Rowley (26 km2) and Ipswich (404 km2). The Ipswich River watershed is highly urbanized with Boston 'bedroom' communities encroaching in the headwater region while the Parker is less urbanized and retains a higher proportion of forest. -71.2198 -70.7568 42.8276 42.4965 0 100 meter"

MILES,EML,14.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"Snow pits were excavated at various locations on Niwot Ridge and within the Green Lakes Valley. Temperature and snow density were measured at various depths throughout the snow cover profiles in order to characterize the temperature and snow water equivalent (SWE) of the snowpack throughout the year. Snow density was measured at 10-cm intervals using a 1000-ml cutter. Data on snow grain qualities were collected beginning in the 1994-95 snow season.

MILES,EML,14.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"These data were manually entered using an EasyEntry form and then processed on niwotlter, the NWT LTER workstation. The value in column 5 (horizon thickness) of the data section is the difference between the values in column 3 (height of bottom of horizon above soil surface) and column 4 (height of top of horizon above soil surface). Horizon mass is the product of the horizon thickness and measured weight. Horizon*temperature) is the product of horizon thickness and measured temperature. These derived values were used to calculate snow water equivalents (SWE) and depth-weighted mean temperatures for each profile; those reduced data can be found at: http://niwot.colorado.edu/exec/.extracttoolA?snowateq.mw Additional data associated with the same snow profiles can be found at http://niwot.colorado.edu/data_csvs/snochemh.mw.data.csv http://niwot.colorado.edu/data_csvs/snochemp.mw.data.csv http://niwot.colorado.edu/data_csvs/snowgran.mw.data.csv Additional qualitative and quantitative data (e.g. air temperatures, cloudiness and insolation, wind speed and direction, etc.) were recorded on the original data collection forms but not included in this file. It should be noted that snow profile data were used to characterize snowpack temperatures and water equivalence over large areas. As snow melted, profile locations were moved. Consequently, there are instances where total snow depth for a given location code increased from one date to the next, although no solid precipitation had been recorded for the period. Large changes in total snow depth at a particular location code were often a function of minor relocation of the pit in conjunction with the rugged topography of the area. Most of the snow profile measurements were made on the Saddle grid and location codes 001 through 088 refer to snow cover profile data for grid stakes 1 through 80A, respectively. Location codes of 011 and 012, for example, would be used for snow profile data collected near grid stakes 10A and 11, respectively. Additional snow pit locations (and the respective location codes) were as follows: Saddle N15 site (081), Martinelli central upper slope - M10 site (082), Martinelli east upper slope - M19 site (083), south of Green Lake 4 inlet (084), north of Green Lake 4 inlet (085), Green Lake 4 outlet (086), Green Lake 5 (087), 50m south of creek on Navajo bench (088), Martinelli M2 (089), slightly different Navajo location than 088 (090), snowfence thermistor #3 east (t3e), N15 Saddle site control pit (nco), N15 Saddle site 15nitrate addition pit (no3), N15 Saddle site 15ammonium addition pit (nh4), Arikaree Glacier site (ark), 10 m west of subnivean lysimeter (sub), 15 m south of subnivean lysimeter and 3 m south of Watershed fence (ssb), Martinelli snow drift near road (ma1), Martinelli snow drift 5 m west of Martinelli permanent plot 31 (ma2), Martinelli snow drift at maximum convexity (ma3), Green Lake 5 north facing slope (g5n), Green Lake 5 valley floor (g5v), Green Lake 5 south facing slope (g5s), Green Lake 4 valley floor (g4v), Green Lake 4 south facing slope (g4s), Green Lake 3 north facing slope (g3n), Green Lake 3 valley floor (g3v), Geen Lake 3 south facing slope (g3s), Albion Village north facing slope (avn), and Albion Village valley floor (avv), east edge of subalpine subnivean lysimeter field (sae), west edge of subalpine subnivean lysimeter field (saw) 300 meters east of T-van towards the subalpine subnivean (t30), south-west of subalpine subnivean lysimeter field (ssw), new site at west edge of subalpine subnivean (swn), Green lake 5 south facing outlet (5os), near C-1 Ameriflux tower[~15m northwest of tower] (hydRA), near C-1 Ameriflux tower[~25m west of tower]: tower tree well 1(tw1), tower tree well 2 (tw2), tower meadow 1 (tm1), tower meadow 2 (tm2), C1 bowling (c1b), southwest of soddie lysimeter field (ssw), Ameriflux tree B-(AB1) index 10 cm from tree (ab1), 50 cm from tree (ab2), 100 cm from tree (ab3), 150 cm from tree (ab4), 200 cm from tree (ab5), 250 cm from tree (ab6), Ameriflux tree 1-(A11) index 10 cm from tree (ab11), 50 cm from tree (ab12), 100 cm from tree (ab13), 150 cm from tree (ab14), 200 cm from tree (ab15), 250 cm from tree (ab16), northeast of soddie, shallow (nes), north mid soddie (nom), northeast mid soddie (nem).

The value in column 5 (horizon thickness) of the data section is the difference between the values in column 3 (height of bottom of horizon above soil surface) and column 4 (height of top of horizon above soil surface). Horizon mass is the product of the horizon thickness and measured weight. Horizon*temperature) is the product of horizon thickness and measured temperature. These derived values were used to calculate snow water equivalents (SWE) and depth-weighted mean temperatures for each profile; those reduced data can be found at: http://niwot.colorado.edu/exec/.extracttoolA?snowateq.mw Additional data associated with the same snow profiles can be found at http://niwot.colorado.edu/data_csvs/snochemh.mw.data.csv http://niwot.colorado.edu/data_csvs/snochemp.mw.data.csv http://niwot.colorado.edu/data_csvs/snowgran.mw.data.csv Additional qualitative and quantitative data (e.g. air temperatures, cloudiness and insolation, wind speed and direction, etc.) were recorded on the original data collection forms but not included in this file. It should be noted that snow profile data were used to characterize snowpack temperatures and water equivalence over large areas. As snow melted, profile locations were moved. Consequently, there are instances where total snow depth for a given location code increased from one date to the next, although no solid precipitation had been recorded for the period. Large changes in total snow depth at a particular location code were often a function of minor relocation of the pit in conjunction with the rugged topography of the area. Most of the snow profile measurements were made on the Saddle grid and location codes 001 through 088 refer to snow cover profile data for grid stakes 1 through 80A, respectively. Location codes of 011 and 012, for example, would be used for snow profile data collected near grid stakes 10A and 11, respectively.

MILES,EML,13.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"The fundamental long-term objective of the seabird component of the Palmer LTER (PAL) has been to identify and understand the mechanistic processes that regulate the mean fitness (population growth rate) of regional penguin populations. Two hypotheses have guided this research, with one suggesting that population mean fitness is best explained by changes in regional krill biomass, and the other proposing that long-term changes in sea ice affects mean fitness by tipping the balance in favor of one species over another in accordance with species-specific evolved life history affinities to sea ice. Although these hypotheses are not mutually exclusive, current evidence in the PAL region tends to favor the latter over the former. Since the inception of PAL, AdÃ©lie penguin populations have effectively collapsed, while those of gentoo and chinstrap penguins have increased dramatically, trends that are spatially and temporally coherent with decreasing regional sea ice duration. AdÃ©lie penguins are an ice-obligate polar species whose life history is intimately linked to the presence of sea ice, while chinstrap and gentoo penguins are ice-intolerant species whose life histories evolved in the sub-Antarctic, where sea ice is a less permanent feature of the marine ecosystem. In contrast, although krill constitute the most important component of the summer diets by mass of these three penguin species, changes in PAL krill abundances have exhibited no long-term trends, and thus fail to explain the divergent patterns in penguin populations evident in our time series. The arrival chronology of adult AdÃ©lie penguins on Humble Island is documented annually through island-wide censuses performed as ice and weather conditions permit. Recorded data (numbers of adults present) provide a measure of the number of adults arriving daily at the breeding colonies, a metric that is sensitive to environmental conditions such as sea ice extent during late winter and early spring. These data are also used in combination with other metrics to determine the optimal window for other, more extensive area-wide breeding population censuses (see CENSUS)."

Measurements are for part of the ice free season (June – December). Discharge could not be determined due to inadequate rating curve and due to beaver activity. Several day gaps occur periodically due to removal for recalibration."

MILES,EML,9.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"We deployed one eddy covariance system to measure NEE of the dominant high marsh at PIE. The location of the tower is ca. Â 600 meters away from the parking lot at Stackyard Road, Rowley, MA, within the Nelson Island Creek catchment. Deployment of the system is year round. The site was equipped with a Campbell ScientificÂ® Closed Path System (CPEC200). Micrometeorological instrumentation was mounted on a tower at a height of 14m above the marsh Â surface. Environmental data were recorded as 10min averages. Air temperature and relative humidity were monitored at the same height as the anemometer (Campbell Scientific HC2S3 enclosed in a naturally aspirated radiation shield). A four-component net radiometer (Hukseflux NR01) was mounted 1.5 m aboveground of the high marsh. At the same height, two sensors (LI190SB, Licor) monitored incoming and reflected photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). In addition, a pressure transducer (Campbell Scientific CS456) recorded water table height at the high marsh. Soil temperature at a depth of 2cm, 6cm, 10cm, 20cm and 40cm was measured with (TCAV-L; Campbell Scientific; Logan, Utah, USA), and soil heat flux at a depth of 8 cm was measured with two soil heat flux plates (HFP01-SC; Campbell Scientific; Logan, Utah, USA).Â  This data was recorded on a separate CR3000 datalogger.Â Â Â Â Â  Turbulent fluxes of momentum, sensible heat, latent heat and CO2 were determined by the eddy covariance technique (Baldocchi et al. 1988). Half hourly CO2 and H2O fluxes were calculated as the covariance between the turbulent departures from the mean of the 10 Hz vertical wind speed measured with a 3D sonic anemometer (CSAT3; Campbell Scientific; Logan, Utah, USA) and the CO2 and H2O dry mixing ratio measured with the closed path analyzer.Â  Fluxes were processed using EdiRe software (Robert Clement, University of Edinburgh) and reported using the meteorological sign convention where negative NEE indicates carbon uptake and positive NEE indicates carbon loss from the ecosystem.Â  Two coordinate rotations were performed on the wind components, and the time lag between wind and CO2 mixing ratio measurements was determined and removed for each averaging interval of 30min. For every 30 min period, a factor for the correction of the frequency attenuation of the flux was calculated according to Moore [1986] and applied to the flux. Fluxes were calculated using the Edire software (version 1.5.0.32, R. Clement, University of Edinburgh, UK). Afterward, fluxes were filtered for system malfunctioning and calibration periods, integral turbulence characteristics, stationarity, and wind direction [Foken etal., 2012]. We also excluded measurements when less than 80% of the flux was generated within the study area. Thresholds in friction velocity (uâ) for nighttime fluxes were determined using REddyProc . To continuously monitor aboveground biomass, we calculated a broadband normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) based on the approach of Wilson and Meyers [2007]. Incoming (i) and reflected (r) Solar (S) and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) measurements were converted into red and near-infrared reflectance. Solar zenith effects were removed by using data exclusively around solar noon (10 A.M.â2 P.M. EST). In our system, spring tides occurred around noon, so that simultaneous radiation measurements recorded the effect of tidal inundation at that time. A decrease in NDVI would reflect that during inundation the amount of biomass that was air exposed was smaller than under nonflooded conditions. We included this effect in our NEE model by creating two continuous time series of NDVI to simulate flooded and nonflooded conditions: NDVIall which included spring tide effects, and a reference time series, NDVIref, which represented nonflooded conditions. NEE is gap-filled with a modified PLIRTLE model (NEE=GPP+Reco), using NDVI_all, air temperature and PAR as input. GPP_all and Reco_all are estimated using the two sub-models of the PLIRTLE model. GPP_ref and Reco_ref are modelled with NDVI_ref as input variable and thus represent the fluxes occurring if no tidal inundation had occurred. References: Baldocchi et al.

MILES,EML,17.xml,Resource Creation/Revision Date,/eml:eml/dataset/pubDate,"20120806"
MILES,EML,17.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"Yearly snow surveys were conducted in the Green Lakes Valley in the City of Boulder Watershed at the estimated peak of snowpack in late spring. Over a period of several days, surveying teams (1 to several people) traversed valley slopes measuring snow depth with avalanche probes. Locations of each depth measurement were recorded as waypoints in Garmin hand-held GPS units (eTrex Legend and eTrex Legend H models). Snow depths were recorded on standardized field sheets along with dates, recorder names, waypoint numbers, and comments. GPS locations were downloaded as text files from Garmin units using Topo! software, specifying NAD83 for surveys conducted after 2009. Download files contained waypoint number, latitude, longitude, date, and elevation. Each file was imported into a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet and snow depths corresponding to waypoints were entered manually from field sheets.

MILES,EML,8.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"We deployed one eddy covariance system to measure NEE of the dominant high marsh at PIE. The location of the tower is ca. Â 600 meters away from the parking lot at Stackyard Road, Rowley, MA, within the Nelson Island Creek catchment. Deployment of the system is year round. The site was equipped with a Campbell ScientificÂ® Closed Path System (CPEC200). Micrometeorological instrumentation was mounted on a tower at a height of 14m above the marsh Â surface. Environmental data were recorded as 10min averages. Air temperature and relative humidity were monitored at the same height as the anemometer (Campbell Scientific HC2S3 enclosed in a naturally aspirated radiation shield). A four-component net radiometer (Hukseflux NR01) was mounted 1.5 m aboveground of the high marsh. At the same height, two sensors (LI190SB, Licor) monitored incoming and reflected photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). In addition, a pressure transducer (Campbell Scientific CS456) recorded water table height at the high marsh. Soil temperature at a depth of 2cm, 6cm, 10cm, 20cm and 40cm was measured with (TCAV-L; Campbell Scientific; Logan, Utah, USA), and soil heat flux at a depth of 8 cm was measured with two soil heat flux plates (HFP01-SC; Campbell Scientific; Logan, Utah, USA).Â  This data was recorded on a separate CR3000 datalogger.Â Â Â Â Â  Turbulent fluxes of momentum, sensible heat, latent heat and CO2 were determined by the eddy covariance technique (Baldocchi et al. 1988). Half hourly CO2 and H2O fluxes were calculated as the covariance between the turbulent departures from the mean of the 10 Hz vertical wind speed measured with a 3D sonic anemometer (CSAT3; Campbell Scientific; Logan, Utah, USA) and the CO2 and H2O dry mixing ratio measured with the closed path analyzer.Â  Fluxes were processed using EdiRe software (Robert Clement, University of Edinburgh) and reported using the meteorological sign convention where negative NEE indicates carbon uptake and positive NEE indicates carbon loss from the ecosystem.Â  Two coordinate rotations were performed on the wind components, and the time lag between wind and CO2 mixing ratio measurements was determined and removed for each averaging interval of 30min. For every 30 min period, a factor for the correction of the frequency attenuation of the flux was calculated according to Moore [1986] and applied to the flux. Fluxes were calculated using the Edire software (version 1.5.0.32, R. Clement, University of Edinburgh, UK). Afterward, fluxes were filtered for system malfunctioning and calibration periods, integral turbulence characteristics, stationarity, and wind direction [Foken etal., 2012]. We also excluded measurements when less than 80% of the flux was generated within the study area. Thresholds in friction velocity (uâ) for nighttime fluxes were determined using REddyProc . To continuously monitor aboveground biomass, we calculated a broadband normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) based on the approach of Wilson and Meyers [2007]. Incoming (i) and reflected (r) Solar (S) and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) measurements were converted into red and near-infrared reflectance. Solar zenith effects were removed by using data exclusively around solar noon (10 A.M.â2 P.M. EST). In our system, spring tides occurred around noon, so that simultaneous radiation measurements recorded the effect of tidal inundation at that time. A decrease in NDVI would reflect that during inundation the amount of biomass that was air exposed was smaller than under nonflooded conditions. We included this effect in our NEE model by creating two continuous time series of NDVI to simulate flooded and nonflooded conditions: NDVIall which included spring tide effects, and a reference time series, NDVIref, which represented nonflooded conditions. NEE is gap-filled with a modified PLIRTLE model (NEE=GPP+Reco), using NDVI_all, air temperature and PAR as input. GPP_all and Reco_all are estimated using the two sub-models of the PLIRTLE model. GPP_ref and Reco_ref are modelled with NDVI_ref as input variable and thus represent the fluxes occurring if no tidal inundation had occurred. References: Baldocchi et al.

MILES,EML,8.xml,Resource Lineage,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"We deployed one eddy covariance system to measure NEE of the dominant high marsh at PIE. The location of the tower is ca. Â 600 meters away from the parking lot at Stackyard Road, Rowley, MA, within the Nelson Island Creek catchment. Deployment of the system is year round. The site was equipped with a Campbell ScientificÂ® Closed Path System (CPEC200). Micrometeorological instrumentation was mounted on a tower at a height of 14m above the marsh Â surface. Environmental data were recorded as 10min averages. Air temperature and relative humidity were monitored at the same height as the anemometer (Campbell Scientific HC2S3 enclosed in a naturally aspirated radiation shield). A four-component net radiometer (Hukseflux NR01) was mounted 1.5 m aboveground of the high marsh. At the same height, two sensors (LI190SB, Licor) monitored incoming and reflected photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). In addition, a pressure transducer (Campbell Scientific CS456) recorded water table height at the high marsh. Soil temperature at a depth of 2cm, 6cm, 10cm, 20cm and 40cm was measured with (TCAV-L; Campbell Scientific; Logan, Utah, USA), and soil heat flux at a depth of 8 cm was measured with two soil heat flux plates (HFP01-SC; Campbell Scientific; Logan, Utah, USA).Â  This data was recorded on a separate CR3000 datalogger.Â Â Â Â Â  Turbulent fluxes of momentum, sensible heat, latent heat and CO2 were determined by the eddy covariance technique (Baldocchi et al. 1988). Half hourly CO2 and H2O fluxes were calculated as the covariance between the turbulent departures from the mean of the 10 Hz vertical wind speed measured with a 3D sonic anemometer (CSAT3; Campbell Scientific; Logan, Utah, USA) and the CO2 and H2O dry mixing ratio measured with the closed path analyzer.Â  Fluxes were processed using EdiRe software (Robert Clement, University of Edinburgh) and reported using the meteorological sign convention where negative NEE indicates carbon uptake and positive NEE indicates carbon loss from the ecosystem.Â  Two coordinate rotations were performed on the wind components, and the time lag between wind and CO2 mixing ratio measurements was determined and removed for each averaging interval of 30min. For every 30 min period, a factor for the correction of the frequency attenuation of the flux was calculated according to Moore [1986] and applied to the flux. Fluxes were calculated using the Edire software (version 1.5.0.32, R. Clement, University of Edinburgh, UK). Afterward, fluxes were filtered for system malfunctioning and calibration periods, integral turbulence characteristics, stationarity, and wind direction [Foken etal., 2012]. We also excluded measurements when less than 80% of the flux was generated within the study area. Thresholds in friction velocity (uâ) for nighttime fluxes were determined using REddyProc . To continuously monitor aboveground biomass, we calculated a broadband normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) based on the approach of Wilson and Meyers [2007]. Incoming (i) and reflected (r) Solar (S) and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) measurements were converted into red and near-infrared reflectance. Solar zenith effects were removed by using data exclusively around solar noon (10 A.M.â2 P.M. EST). In our system, spring tides occurred around noon, so that simultaneous radiation measurements recorded the effect of tidal inundation at that time. A decrease in NDVI would reflect that during inundation the amount of biomass that was air exposed was smaller than under nonflooded conditions. We included this effect in our NEE model by creating two continuous time series of NDVI to simulate flooded and nonflooded conditions: NDVIall which included spring tide effects, and a reference time series, NDVIref, which represented nonflooded conditions. NEE is gap-filled with a modified PLIRTLE model (NEE=GPP+Reco), using NDVI_all, air temperature and PAR as input. GPP_all and Reco_all are estimated using the two sub-models of the PLIRTLE model. GPP_ref and Reco_ref are modelled with NDVI_ref as input variable and thus represent the fluxes occurring if no tidal inundation had occurred. References: Baldocchi et al.

MILES,EML,1.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"YSI 6200 data sondes were deployed vertically in a pool deep enough to contain water during dry conditions. The sonde was deployed in a PVC tube, which was attached to ree-bar driven into the stream bed. The PVC tube had holes drilled to allow adequate water circulation. Dissolved oxygen measurements are of poor quality because the the bottom of the pool was often filled in with detritus following intermediate sized storms, leading to anoxic conditions. To alleviate this problem, the PVC tube was raised 10.1 cm on 7/16/03. The file for 2001 includes the raw depth measurement (RAWYSI_Depth), as well as the depth measurement corrected to the YSI depth after the change in tube height (YSI_Depth_STD) and for which the rating curve has been standardized. The PVC tube was surveyed upon original deployment in 2001 and resurveyed in 2002 to ensure that elevation did not change during winter ice period. No change was detected. No evidence of change has been noted through 2006 based on discharge measurements. See discussion below for development of the discharge-stage relationship. Recalibration of oxygen, conducitivty and depth was performed roughly every 4-6 weeks. Instrument drift during deployment periods was not significant. ADDITIONAL RESEARCH LOCATION COORDINATES: In addition to the decimal degree coordinates given above, locations are also given here in Massachusetts State Plane coordinates. The stream is called SawMill Br. and is located in Burlington MA. Small amounts of forest remain (~14% in 1999), much of which is along the stream channel near the gaging site. STATION STATE X STATE Y YSI-SB 225840 919310 NOTES AND COMMENTS: Dissolved oxygen concentrations generally reflect water column levels. However, due to the position of the sonde, detritus periodically covered the bottom of the sondes where the D.O. probe is located, leading to anoxic conditions. It is likely that low D.O. levels reflect benthic conditions. Velocity measurements were made using a Marsh McBirney current meter and starting in 2009 with a Sontek Flowtracker. Discharge estimates in Saw Mill are based on a power rating curve that contains measurements up to a stage depth of 1.2 meters, which is above bankfull stage. Rating curve has an R2 of 0.89 using 40 measurements between 2001 and 2009. The rating curve has not noticeably changed over the period. Prior to 2007, stage was measured with various other instruments (YSI, Sigma depth sonde, HOBO). All files in this series (2001-2009) are now standardized to HOBO depth. The rating curve is based on the standardized HOBO depth's (and actual HOBO depths since 2007). CALCULATIONS: Discharge rating curve : Discharge (l/s) = 889.65*depth^5.8788 where depth is Adj_HOBO_Depth Several depth are included in this file to allow comparison with earlier file version. RAWYSI_Depth is the depth measured by the YSI and is used by an initial, preliminary rating curve. YSI_Depth_STD is depth adjusted to standardize for the change in stilling well depth in July 2003. The column Depth_Device is included when combining files from several years, over which several different devices were used to calculate depth. Depth_STD is the depth that is standardized across all measurement devices so that a single rating curve can be applied. The rating curve is standardized to the Hobo depth measurements, which were started in 2006. The difference between Hobo data logger depth measurements and YSI data logger depth measurements (YSI_DEPTH_STD) is 0.211m (StandardizedHoboDepths = YSI_Depth_STD + 0.21) Also, at times depth and discharge may be periodically erroneous due to leaf pack accumulation at a riffle downstream causing backup. We remove this whenever we visit the site. Generally we believe the depth error is on the order of 2-4 centemeters. The depth data have not been corrected for errors associated with temporary debris dams. OLD RATING CURVE ( prior to Sept 2009 revision): Discharge measurements in Saw Mill are based on a power rating curve that contains measurements up to a depth of 0.6m (using the column RAWYSI_Depth).

MILES,EML,1.xml,Resource Lineage,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"YSI 6200 data sondes were deployed vertically in a pool deep enough to contain water during dry conditions. The sonde was deployed in a PVC tube, which was attached to ree-bar driven into the stream bed. The PVC tube had holes drilled to allow adequate water circulation. Dissolved oxygen measurements are of poor quality because the the bottom of the pool was often filled in with detritus following intermediate sized storms, leading to anoxic conditions. To alleviate this problem, the PVC tube was raised 10.1 cm on 7/16/03. The file for 2001 includes the raw depth measurement (RAWYSI_Depth), as well as the depth measurement corrected to the YSI depth after the change in tube height (YSI_Depth_STD) and for which the rating curve has been standardized. The PVC tube was surveyed upon original deployment in 2001 and resurveyed in 2002 to ensure that elevation did not change during winter ice period. No change was detected. No evidence of change has been noted through 2006 based on discharge measurements. See discussion below for development of the discharge-stage relationship. Recalibration of oxygen, conducitivty and depth was performed roughly every 4-6 weeks. Instrument drift during deployment periods was not significant. ADDITIONAL RESEARCH LOCATION COORDINATES: In addition to the decimal degree coordinates given above, locations are also given here in Massachusetts State Plane coordinates. The stream is called SawMill Br. and is located in Burlington MA. Small amounts of forest remain (~14% in 1999), much of which is along the stream channel near the gaging site. STATION STATE X STATE Y YSI-SB 225840 919310 NOTES AND COMMENTS: Dissolved oxygen concentrations generally reflect water column levels. However, due to the position of the sonde, detritus periodically covered the bottom of the sondes where the D.O. probe is located, leading to anoxic conditions. It is likely that low D.O. levels reflect benthic conditions. Velocity measurements were made using a Marsh McBirney current meter and starting in 2009 with a Sontek Flowtracker. Discharge estimates in Saw Mill are based on a power rating curve that contains measurements up to a stage depth of 1.2 meters, which is above bankfull stage. Rating curve has an R2 of 0.89 using 40 measurements between 2001 and 2009. The rating curve has not noticeably changed over the period. Prior to 2007, stage was measured with various other instruments (YSI, Sigma depth sonde, HOBO). All files in this series (2001-2009) are now standardized to HOBO depth. The rating curve is based on the standardized HOBO depth's (and actual HOBO depths since 2007). CALCULATIONS: Discharge rating curve : Discharge (l/s) = 889.65*depth^5.8788 where depth is Adj_HOBO_Depth Several depth are included in this file to allow comparison with earlier file version. RAWYSI_Depth is the depth measured by the YSI and is used by an initial, preliminary rating curve. YSI_Depth_STD is depth adjusted to standardize for the change in stilling well depth in July 2003. The column Depth_Device is included when combining files from several years, over which several different devices were used to calculate depth. Depth_STD is the depth that is standardized across all measurement devices so that a single rating curve can be applied. The rating curve is standardized to the Hobo depth measurements, which were started in 2006. The difference between Hobo data logger depth measurements and YSI data logger depth measurements (YSI_DEPTH_STD) is 0.211m (StandardizedHoboDepths = YSI_Depth_STD + 0.21) Also, at times depth and discharge may be periodically erroneous due to leaf pack accumulation at a riffle downstream causing backup. We remove this whenever we visit the site. Generally we believe the depth error is on the order of 2-4 centemeters. The depth data have not been corrected for errors associated with temporary debris dams. OLD RATING CURVE ( prior to Sept 2009 revision): Discharge measurements in Saw Mill are based on a power rating curve that contains measurements up to a depth of 0.6m (using the column RAWYSI_Depth). Flows above this amount are estimated using a linear extrapolation using the six measurements with the highest flow. Thus flows determined from levels greater than 0.6m are approximate (roughly 1% of the readings in 2001 deployment period). Rating curve below 0.6m is based on a power relationship with an R2 = 0.98. Measurements are based on 12 measurements taken between 2001 and 2003. OLD CALCULATIONS: When stage in SawMill Br. is less than 0.6m : Discharge (l/s) = 1245.2 (depth) 4.782 When stage in SawMill Br. is greater than 0.6m : Discharge (l/s) = 560.7 (depth) – 229.8"

MILES,EML,16.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"Yearly snow surveys were conducted in the Green Lakes Valley in the City of Boulder Watershed at the estimated peak of snowpack in late spring. Over a period of several days, surveying teams (1 to several people) traversed valley slopes measuring snow depth with avalanche probes. Locations of each depth measurement were recorded as waypoints in Garmin hand-held GPS units (eTrex Legend and eTrex Legend H models). Snow depths were recorded on standardized field sheets along with dates, recorder names, waypoint numbers, and comments. GPS locations were downloaded as text files from Garmin units using Topo! software, specifying NAD83 for surveys conducted after 2009. Download files contained waypoint number, latitude, longitude, date, and elevation. Each file was imported into a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet and snow depths corresponding to waypoints were entered manually from field sheets. Shapefiles were constructed in ArcInfo/ArcGIS from dbf files generated either directly from Excel spreadsheets (before 2008) or after importing into Microsoft Access and then exporting as dbfs. All shapefiles are provided in a UTM zone 13 projection and NAD83 horizontal datum. NOTE: This EML metadata file does not contain important geospatial data processing information. Before using any NWT LTER geospatial data read the arcgis metadata XML file in either ISO or FGDC compliant format, using ArcGIS software (ArcCatalog > description), or by viewing the .xml file provided with the geospatial dataset."

MILES,EML,11.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"The objectives of the LTER seabird component during the 92-93 season cruises were similar. These objectives included 1) determining the pelagic abundance and distribution of Adelie Penguins, 2) examining how the physical and biological characteristics of the marine environment influence these parameters and, 3) using these data to identify foraging areas that may be important to Adelie populations being studied as part of land-based work at Palmer Station. Secondary objectives included documenting the abundance and distribution of other seabirds and marine mammals within the LTER study area. The focus of the January cruise was the nearshore foraging habitat,which required sampling at smaller scales. All seabird censuses were thus conducted within approximately 100 kms of Palmer Station while traversing a sampling grid with stations at 10km intervals. The first two days (18-20 January) of this cruise were spent covering the selected grid as rapidly as possible resulting in 45 transects spaced at 45-60 minute intervals. There were no stops at the 10km stations during this Fast Grid phase. Upon completion of the Fast Grid, a force 12 gale suspended data collection for 24 hours. From January 22-25 the grid direction was reversed and the grid repeated. During this Slow Grid phase, 2-M net tows were done at 10km intervals and BOPS and 1-M and 2-M net tows every 20 km. All seabird censusesduring the cruise were done using the procedures outlined in theprevious paragraph."

MILES,EML,18.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"The depth of snow was measured at 88 points on the saddle grid. The 500 x 350 m study area (17.5 ha) consisted of a grid of 8 rows of stakes in an east/west direction and 11 rows of stakes in a north/south direction (for a total of 88 stakes). The stakes were located 50 m apart. Each stake was given a point identification number starting with 1 in the southwest corner and progressing in an easterly direction for each of the east/west rows so that if head of this file represented the north compass point and the tail represented the south compass point, then the grid would look like this: 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 801(=80A) 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 701(=70A) 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 601(=60A) 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 501(=50A) 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 401(=40A) 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 301(=30A) 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 201(=20A) 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 101(=10A)"

MILES,EML,18.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"The Saddle grid snow survey was initiated in 1982 by Jim Halfpenny; Skip Walker assumed responsibility for the continuation of this survey in the autumn of 1992. Prior to that time, depths were measured at a location (in the vicinity of a grid stake in an area characterized by a great deal of snow depth variability) deemed to be representative of a 'mean' snow depth for that particular grid stake. These earlier data can be found in http://niwot.colorado.edu/data_csvs/saddsnow.jh.meta.txt From 30 October 1992 until 31 January 1993, 1 to 5 measurements were made in the vicinity of stakes in areas characterized by a great deal of snow depth variability, means of such measurements were calculated, and it was those means that were manually entered into the computer. The EasyEntry program for manual entry of the snow survey data, as well as the Unix programs for post-EasyEntry processing, were modified for all data collected after 1 February 1993 in order to allow for entry of 5 separate snow-depth measurements associated with each of the grid stakes, i.e. at the grid stake as well as 1 to 2 m in each of the four cardinal directions from the grid stake. The files produced by these programs contain the means in addition to the 'raw' measure- ments used to derive those means. For the sake of consistency, columns containing missing value indicators were inserted in the appropriate positions of the pre-February 1993 data prior to their incorporation in this file. It should be noted, however, that a single measurement at a particular stake prior to February 1993 may, in fact, be either the result of 'mental' averaging in the field or be a true calculated mean of more than a single measurement. Also note that data prior to autumn 1992 were not available for the initial iteration of this file. The initial column in the data section contains a sort number used to faciliate data processing prior to incorporation into ARC/INFO format. The hard copy data sheet for the 21 March 1997 survey contained the note '?200' for grid stake 65, and '>370' for grid stake 55. Both were entered as missing values."
