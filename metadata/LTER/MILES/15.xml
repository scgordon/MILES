<abstract>
<para>
	A snowfence was built in 1993 on the Niwot Ridge Saddle grid 
	to determine the effects of changes in snowpack on a number of variables. The 
	study area was 60m x 125m. Snow depths were measured at each of 147 points 
	within the snowfence experiment area and at 6 control locations outside of but 
	near the snowfence experiment area. Of the 147 points, 84 were located on the 
	leeward (east) side of the snowfence, 56 were located on the windward (west)
	side of the snowfence, and 7 were located along the snowfence itself. These 
	measurements were made weekly to biweekly. Sampling locations were each 
	given a unique point indentification number in order that these data could 
	be incorporated into the Saddle GIS. The snowfence was oriented in a 
	north/south direction and was 60 m long. Each of the point identification 
	numbers had a coordinate within the experiment area. The first number of 
	the coordinate was the distance in m from the snowfence in an east/west 
	direction, negative numbers being west of the snowfence and positive 
	numbers being east of the fence. The second number in the coordinate 
	was the distance in m from the southern terminus of the snowfence in 
	a northerly direction. Point identification numbers and coordinates for 
	the windward drift were: 200 (-40,0), 201 (-40,10), 202 (-40,20), 
	203 (-40,30), 204 (-40,40), 205 (-40,50), 206 (-40,60), 207 (-35,0), 
	208 (-35,10), 209 (-35,20), 210 (-35,30), 211 (-35,40), 212 (-35,50),

	218 (-30,40), 219 (-30,50), 220 (-30,60), 221 (-25,0), 222 (-25,10), 
	223 (-25,20), 224 (-25,30), 225 (-25,40), 226 (-25,50), 227 (-25,60), 
	228 (-20,0), 229 (-20,10), 230 (-20,20), 231 (-20,30), 232 (-20,40), 
	233 (-20,50), 234 (-20,60), 235 (-15,0), 236 (-15,10), 237 (-15,20), 
	238 (-15,30), 239 (-15,40), 240 (-15,50), 241 (-15,60), 242 (-10,0), 
	243 (-10,10), 244 (-10,20), 245 (-10,30), 246 (-10,40), 247 (-10,50), 
	248 (-10,60), 249 (-5,0), 250 (-5,10), 251 (-5,20), 252 (-5,30), 
	253 (-5,40), 254 (-5,50), 255 (-5,60). Point identification numbers 
	and coordinates for the leeward drift were: 256 (5,0), 257 (5,10), 
	258 (5,20), 259 (5,30), 260 (5,40), 261 (5,50), 262 (5,60), 263 (10,0), 
	264 (10,10), 265 (10,20), 266 (10,30), 267 (10,40), 268 (10,50),

	340 (60,60). Point identification numbers and coordinates for
	the points directly along the fence were: 341 (0,0), 342 (0,10), 
	343 (0,20), 344 (0,30), 345 (0,40), 346 (0,50), 346 (0,60). Point 
	identification numbers and locations for the control points were: 
	113 (approximately 10 m south of the -30,0 coordinate) in the 
	Acomastylidetum rossii vegetation association, 114 (approximately 
	11 m south of the -25,0 coordinate) in the Acomastylidetum rossii 
	vegetation association, 115 (approximately 8 m south of the 55,0
	coordinate) in the Kobresietum myosuroidis vegetation association, 
	116 (approximately 5 m north of the 50,60 coordinate) in the Kobresietum 
	myosuroidis vegetation association, 117 (approximately 3 m north of the 
	-23,60 coordinate) in the Rhodiolo integrifoliae vegetation association, 
	118 (approximately 5 m north of the -21,60 coordinate) in the Rhodiolo 
	integrifoliae vegetation association. Control points are indicated by a
	'C' in column 2.</para>

	The documentation for this file was created by Susan Kindig in May of 1993,
	with additional information being supplied by Rick Ingersoll and Brad
	Lewis. Data for 30 October 1992 to 7 May 1993 were added to the data
	section at this time and the file was placed under sccs control.
	[RCI 2 June 1993] Data for 29 May 1993 were appended on 2 June 1993.
	[RCI 2 June 1993] All data beginning 30 October 1992 were double-
	entered using EasyEntry programs (see "The Management of NWT LTER Data
	on the PC") and then processed on a Sun SPARC 2 (see "The Management of
	NWT LTER Data on culter").[RCI 14 June 1993] Data for 22 June 1993

	to the data section on 29 April 1994.[RCI 29 April 1994] The snow
	depth for point identification number 263 on 2 November 1993 was changed
	from 290 cm to 115 cm (because the original measurement had been in cm
	but had been thought to be in inches) on 16 May 1994.[RCI 16 May 1994]

	1994.[RCI 18 May 1994] Data for 2 June 1994 were appended to the

					<para>Snow depth measurements at the control points were not
						initiated until 9 January 1993.</para><para>
						Prior to the spring of 1995, two distinct lenticular drifts formed,
						a large leeward and a smaller windward drift. As a result of the
						unusually heavy snows during the spring of 1995, these two drifts
						actually merged to form a single large drift that engulfed the 
						snowfence itself. Consequently snow depths were recorded at the
						fence during the spring of 1995, and these measurements were originally
						listed in the comments section of this file. In the spring of
						1996 it was determined that measurements should be routinely taken
						along the snowfence. The entry and processing programs were changed
						accordingly and the 1995 snow depths were inserted into the data section. 
						The hard copy data form for 26 July 1995 contained the following
						comment written by Lee Turner "Put down 26 July 95 as the last day
						with any snow in the snowfence area".</para><para>
						The hard copy data form for 31 January 1996 contained the following
						comment written by Lee Turner "snow fell with no wind, 30" of fresh
						powder".</para><para>
						Notes on the hard copy data form for 28 January 1996 indicated that
						an ice lens was present at coordinates 10,40 (ID #267) and 20,40 
						(ID #282).</para><para>
						A note on the hard copy data form for 14 February 1996 indicated 
						that the measurements at coordinates 20,60 (ID #284), 20,50 (ID #283), 
						and 20,40 (ID #282) may not be correct. After consultation with L. Turner 
						it was determined that there may have been an ice lens at those coordinates.
						A note on the hard copy data form for 7 July 1997 indicated that the 
						fence drift had melted out 100% on 7 July 1997.</para>
